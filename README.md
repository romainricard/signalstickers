## About
A nice and handy gallery to browse and download sticker packs for Signal.
This site is served on [signalstickers.com](https://signalstickers.com),
directly from this Github repository.

## Adding a sticker pack to this site
Use the tool [Contribute](https://signalstickers.com/contribute) at the top of
`signalstickers.com`, and follow the guide!

> Note: adding a sticker pack requires [a Github account](https://github.com/join).
> It's free!

### Contribution guidelines
We will accept all stickers, **except**:
+ Stickers packs that call for hatred or violence against people or communities
  based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
  expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
  identity and orientation;
+ Sticker packs that directly promote a brand or a company.

The idea is to keep a family atmosphere: I'd like my grandmother to be able to
navigate sticker packs quietly.

## Q&A

### How can I create a sticker pack?
Follow the tutorial on the [Signal support site](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360031836512-Stickers#h_c2a0a45b-862f-4d12-9ab1-d9a6844062ca)
to upload your stickers to Signal.

> Note: when creating stickers, don't forget to add a white stroke to improve
> legibility on dark themes! You can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/ondondil/4b8564b404696b3255253b467b413de9#gistcomment-3118471)
> or use [this project](https://framagit.org/luc/stickerify-for-signal)
> to automatically resize and add a white stroke on all the PNG and WEBP images
> of a directory.

### Am I required to add my sticker pack to this site to share it with my friends?
**No**. You can just send any sticker to your friends and they will be able to
install the pack, or you can share your sticker pack using the `signal.art` link
that you got when you created your sticker pack, or by using the share button
from inside the signal app's sticker managment screen.

Do not hesitate to post your pack on social networks using the hashtag
`#makeprivacystick` as well!

### Can you create a sticker pack for me?
